<h1>For my fourth commit I'll just type what I learned:
    First, you have to link the folder you're working on to github.
    That will be possible using the command "git init" (only once)
Later you save what you've typed on the created files and "move" them to a type of zone 
where github will detect their updates or changes. Here you have to use git add filesname
or just git add . to include every file
Finally, if you want to create a commit (a kind of screenshot of part of your work in a certain moment) 
you'll just type git commit -m messageorcommitsname</h1>

<h1>In order to see your commits, type git log --oneline which will show a list with your commits.
    They'll have a code you'll use to go to that part of your work you saved with git reset --hard givencode
</h1>

<h1>Now I'm going to type this just to try the command push</h1>
